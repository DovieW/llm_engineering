      "\n",
      "**2. Customer Service & Support:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Chatbots & Virtual Assistants:** Generative AI is powering more sophisticated chatbots that can handle complex queries, provide personalized support, and even engage in empathetic conversations.  Think better, faster customer service.\n",
      "* **Ticket Summarization:** Quickly summarize customer support tickets, allowing agents to quickly understand the issue.\n",
      "* **Agent Assist Tools:** Suggest responses, provide relevant knowledge base articles, and automate repetitive tasks for customer service agents.\n",
      "* **Sentiment Analysis & Response Generation:** Analyze customer feedback (reviews, emails, chats) and generate appropriate responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Product Development & Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Design Ideation:** Generate new product designs based on specified criteria, style guides, or even user feedback. Tools like Microsoft Copilot can provide inspiration and variations.\n",
      "* **Code Generation & Assistance:**  Tools like GitHub Copilot and Tabnine assist developers by generating code snippets, completing functions, and even writing entire programs based on comments.\n",
      "* **Prototyping:** Quickly create 3D models, mockups, and visual prototypes from text descriptions, accelerating the product design process.\n",
      "* **Testing & Simulation:** Generate synthetic data to test product functionality, identify bugs, and improve user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Data Analysis & Insights:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Report Generation:** Automate the creation of reports from various data sources, simplifying data analysis for non-technical users.\n",
      "* **Data Augmentation:** Generate synthetic data to expand training datasets for machine learning models, improving accuracy.\n",
      "* **Trend Identification:** Analyze large datasets and generate insights about emerging trends.\n",
      "* **Anomaly Detection:**  Identify unusual patterns or outliers in data that might indicate fraud, errors, or new opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Internal Operations & Automation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Document Summarization:** Quickly summarize lengthy legal documents, reports, or proposals.\n",
      "* **Meeting Minutes & Action Item Generation:** Automatically generate summaries of meetings and highlight key action items.\n",
      "* **Email Marketing Campaign Optimization:** Generate variations of email subject lines, content, and calls to action to improve campaign performance.\n",
      "* **Internal Knowledge Base Creation:** Generate draft documents and articles for internal knowledge bases.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Specific Generative AI Models & Their Applications (Examples):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **GPT Models (GPT-3, GPT-4):** Versatile for text generation, translation, summarization, and creative writing.\n",
      "* **DALL-E 2, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion:**  For generating images from text prompts.\n",
      "* **ChatGPT:** Excellent for conversational AI, chatbots, and content creation.\n",
      "* **GitHub Copilot:** AI-powered code completion and generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations & Challenges:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Data Quality:** Generative AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on.\n",
      "* **Bias:** AI models can inherit biases from their training data, leading to potentially unfair or discriminatory outputs.\n",
      "* **Hallucinations:** Generative AI can sometimes generate factually incorrect or nonsensical information (often called \"hallucinations\").  Careful validation is needed.\n",
      "* **Ethical Concerns:**  Issues around copyright, plagiarism, and the responsible use of AI-generated content need to be addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Resources for Learning More:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **OpenAI:** [https://openai.com/](https://openai.com/)\n",
      "* **Google AI:** [https://ai.google/](https://ai.google/)\n",
      "* **Microsoft AI:** [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai)\n",

    "\n",
    "It seems strange, right? We just used OpenAI code to call Ollama?? What's going on?!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the scoop:\n",
    "\n",
    "The python class `OpenAI` is simply code written by OpenAI engineers that makes calls over the internet to an endpoint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `openai.chat.completions.create()`, this python code just makes a web request to the following url: \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Code like this is known as a \"client library\" - it's just wrapper code that runs on your machine to make web requests. The actual power of GPT is running on OpenAI's cloud behind this API, not on your computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI was so popular, that lots of other AI providers provided identical web endpoints, so you could use the same approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Ollama has an endpoint running on your local box at http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions  \n",
    "And in week 2 we'll discover that lots of other providers do this too, including Gemini and DeepSeek.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then the team at OpenAI had a great idea: they can extend their client library so you can specify a different 'base url', and use their library to call any compatible API.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you say: `ollama_via_openai = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1', api_key='ollama')`  \n",
    "Then this will make the same endpoint calls, but to Ollama instead of OpenAI."
